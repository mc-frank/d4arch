Clover is a very fun project for me, but as long as it&#039;s not on the Play Store not a lot of people download it or know about it. That and I don&#039;t have any statistics of how many people download it from f-droid and I don&#039;t know about any crashes. (I don&#039;t want to implement botnet solutions for that). No reviews or user feedback through f-droid either.<br><br>I was working on imageboard software myself ( https://github.com/Floens/uchan ) and still want to make Clover multi site and make it compatible with it. I won&#039;t abandon it and I will update Clover when there are any issues with new Android versions, but don&#039;t expect a lot of new development from me. It&#039;s just that I don&#039;t get back what I put into it. Take a look how much code Clover actually is, it&#039;s a lot. I barely receive donations. The only thing that would spike development again is putting it back on the Play Store, and they&#039;ll probably ban me if I do.<br><br>I want to work on another app that has a wider audience than Clover. I&#039;ve learned a lot about Android development from Clover and I want to put that to good use in something else. I don&#039;t want to be so dependent on external services. And I don&#039;t want something that&#039;s risky for the store rules.<br><br>So again, not abandoning it, I&#039;ll tag a new release when I get the current issues fixed, and multi site will come if I want to keep working on µchan, but that&#039;s about it."
